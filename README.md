[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics-engine/fork)

Cannlytics provides a user-friendly interface to quickly receive samples, perform analyses, collect and review results, and publish certificates of analysis (CoAs). There are also built in logistics, CRM (client relationship management), inventory management, and invoicing tools. The Cannlytics engine comes with **batteries included**, but you are always welcome to supercharge your setup with modifications and custom components.

## Installation

You can install the Cannlytics engine from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cannlytics/).

```shell
pip install cannlytics
```

## Authentication, Data, and File Management

Cannlytics leverages Firebase by default for a database, file storage, and authentication.

## Traceability

Cannlytics supports the [Leaf Data Systems](https://s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/leafdata-wa-prod/help/Addendum+C--API+Documentation.pdf) and [Metrc](https://api-ok.metrc.com/Documentation) APIs out-of-the-box.
